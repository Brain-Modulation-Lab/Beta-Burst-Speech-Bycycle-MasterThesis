 - **annot_anova2_ttest.m** creates an annotation table (in the form of a txt file) for each subject for each bycycle burst feature for each intertrial subdivision (all speech metrics are here considered) saving the ANOVA 2 way F-statistic and correspective p value (indicative of how strongly the feature is changing during the trials of a single electrode and depending on the trial subdivision), and the t-statistic with the corresponding p value result of the comparison of the activity with a low speech metric score vs a high speech metric score (indicative of how the feature is changing in each experimental window with respect to the speech metric).
   
 - **electrode_anova2_ttest.m** depits at the single electrode level the continuous and the discrete trend of each bycycle burst feature considering the intertrial subdivisions plotting also the F-statistic and t-statistics explained above. (see fig "DBS3011 ecog 131 features per metric.jpg")
 
 - **cortex_anova2_ttest.m** plots over the anatomical substrates each bycycle burst features' significant (p<0.05) F-statistic and t-statistics explained above considering the intertrial subdivisions (see fig "cortex ... .jpg")
